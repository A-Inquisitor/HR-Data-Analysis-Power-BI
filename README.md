# HR-Data-Analysis-Power-BI

**Project Overview:**
Importing data relevant to HR statistics and create a Power BI report to showcase the key information of staff. The reason I undertook this task, is to work with non numerical data and assess the relationship and indicators that can arise, to develop my intuition that is generally biased for numerical reasoning.

## Overview of the data
The data has standard HR information such as:
 1. Age
 2. Salary
 3. Date values (Date of Join, Date Hierarchy, Day)
 4. Gender
 5. Sum of Salary 
 6. Job Title
 7. Education qualification

## Initial Assessment Overview

I want to be able to evaluate the following:

- Create a HR dashboard with the key information indicators
- How the job title varies with the amount of people who work in that role
- A distribution of genders using a pie chart
- The age distribution of the staff
- The qualifications relative to salary (Degrees against how much they earn) -> this may be a harder task but definitely down to try

## Key Takeaways    

- Having a Master's Degree means a much higher chance of getting the top range of salaries
- HOWEVER, a key point to assess is that having a diploma comparative to a high school diploma is not as useful. As most of the datapoints for a diploma are concentrated in the $35k - $50k region, whereas a majority of the highschool diploma lie in the $45k - $62k region. Through this analysis, a diploma may not be worth the time, either leave with a highschool diploma or go for a Bachelor's Degree.
- The Age distribution shows a large number of 30 year olds working at the job, this is quite expected.
- Headcount has been increasing yearly, growth is natural and steady, as the business grows so will the headcount.


## Learning Points

- Properly utilising bins function for Age data
