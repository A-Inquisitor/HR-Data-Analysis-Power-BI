# HR-Data-Analysis-Power-BI

**Project Overview:**
Importing data relevant to HR statistics and create a Power BI report to showcase the key information of staff. The reason I undertook this task, is to work with non numerical data and assess the relationship and indicators that can arise, to develop my intuition that is generally biased for numerical reasoning.

## Overview of the data
The data has standard HR information such as:
 1. Age
 2. Salary
 3. Date values (Date of Join, Date Hierarchy, Day)
 4. Gender
 5. Sum of Salary 
 6. Job Title
 7. Education qualification

## Initial Assessment Overview

I want to be able to evaluate the following:

- Create a HR dashboard with the key information indicators
- How the job title varies with the amount of people who work in that role
- A distribution of genders using a pie chart
- The age distribution of the staff
- The qualifications relative to salary (Degrees against how much they earn) -> this may be a harder task but definitely down to try
